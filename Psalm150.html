      1. Praise the Most High. <br>
      Praise the Most High in their sanctuary; <br>
      praise them in their mighty heavens. <br>
      2. Praise them for their acts of power; <br>
      praise them for their surpassing greatness. <br>
      3. Praise them with the sounding of the trumpet, <br>
      praise them with the harp and lyre, <br>
      4. Praise them with timbrel and dancing, <br>
      praise them with the strings and pipe, <br>
      5. Praise them with the clash of cymbals, <br>
      praise them with resounding cymbals. <br>
      6. Let everything that has breath praise the Most High. <br>
