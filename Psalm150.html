      Praise the Most High in their sanctuary; <br>
      praise them in their mighty heavens. <br>

      praise them for their surpassing greatness. <br>

      praise them with the harp and lyre, <br>
      4. Praise them with timbrel and dancing, <br>
      praise them with the strings and pipe, <br>
      5. Praise them with the clash of cymbals, <br>
      praise them with resounding cymbals. <br>
